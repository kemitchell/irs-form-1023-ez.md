16. **Are you requesting classification as a supporting organization under section 509(a)(3)?**

    A supporting organization (as defined in section 509(a)(3)) differs from the other types of public charities described in section 509. Instead of describing an organization that conducts a particular kind of activity or that receives financial support from the general public, section 509(a)(3) describes organizations that have established certain relationships in support of public charities described in section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2). Thus, an organization can qualify as a supporting organization (and not be classified as a private foundation) even though it may be funded by a single donor, family, or corporation. This kind of funding ordinarily would indicate private foundation status, but a section 509(a) (3) organization has limited purposes and activities, and gives up a significant degree of independence. A supporting organization is an organization that:

    1. Is organized and operated exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations as described in section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2). These section 509(a)(1) and 509(a)(2) organizations are commonly called publicly supported organizations.

    2. Has one of three types of relationships with one or more organizations described in section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2). It must be:

       1. Operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2) organizations (Type I supporting organization);

       2. Supervised or controlled in connection with one or more section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2) organizations (Type II supporting organization); or

       3. Operated in connection with one or more section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2) organizations (Type III supporting organization).

    3. Is not controlled directly or indirectly by disqualified persons (as defined in section 4946) other than foundation managers and other than one or more organizations described in section 509(a)(1) or 509(a)(2).

For a discussion of tax law issues relating to ACOs, see Notice 2011-20 and FS-2011-11, available at www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Exempt-Organizations-Participating-in-the-MedicareShared-Savings-Program-through-Accountable-Care-Organizations.

    - [ ] Yes

    - [ ] No

23. **Do you maintain or intend to maintain one or more donor advised funds?**

    In general, a donor advised fund is a fund or account that is owned and controlled by the organization but that is separately identified by reference to contributions of a donor or donors and with respect to which a donor (or any person appointed or designated by the donor) has or expects to have advisory privileges concerning the distribution or investment of amounts held in the fund or account by reason of the donor’s status as a donor.

    - [ ] Yes

    - [ ] No

25. **Are you requesting classification as a private operating foundation?**

    Private foundations lack general public support. What distinguishes a private operating foundation from other private foundations is that it engages directly in the active conduct of charitable, religious, educational, and similar activities (as opposed to indirectly carrying out these activities by providing grants to individuals or other organizations). Private operating foundations are subject to more favorable rules than other private foundations in terms of charitable contribution deductions and attracting grants from private foundations. However, to be classified as a private operating foundation, an organization must meet certain tests. Additional information about private operating foundations is available at www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Private-Foundations/Private-Operating-Foundations.

    - [ ] Yes

    - [ ] No

Proc. 2014-11, you must submit the full Form 1023 along with the appropriate reasonable cause statement and a statement confirming you have filed the required annual returns as described in the revenue procedure.
